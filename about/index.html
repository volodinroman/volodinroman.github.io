        <p class="mt-4">My name is Roman Volodin. Currently employed as a Senior Pipeline TD at Sony Pictures Imageworks, I'm solving day
            to day production problems as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p>
        <p>I am passionate about computer graphics and developing innovative technology, that I can apply in CG production pipeline.
            My experience as a digital artist lends a great deal to my ability to communicate with production artists and
            management on a level that is even more natural to their own workflow.</p>
        <p>Always interested in programming, I entered Komsomolsk-on-Amur State Technical University in 2005 as a student of
            Computation Technologies Faculty where besides regular programming I studied cryptography, web design and computational
            geometry. In 2009 I entered a magistracy where the field of my study was computer graphics and multimedia. In
            2011 I successfully graduated the magistracy with a MEng degree.</p>
        <p>Additionally, I enrolled a 3D Animation program at Seneca college in Toronto in 2013 that significantly helped me
            to understand a film production pipeline and combine digital art and the power of programming in my projects
            more effectively.</p>
        <p>I see myself as a strong leader, good communicator and team player, and highly committed to my projects, while always
            striving to experiment and learn new technique and technologies.</p>
